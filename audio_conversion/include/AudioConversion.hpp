     * Recursive function to add converters to the chain of convertion required.

     * When a converter is added, the source sample specification is modified to represent the

     * This sample spec will be used as the source for next convertion.
     * In order to minimize power consumption, resampling operation should be applied
     * on the minimum frame size. So, down-remapping or down-formatting will be done in
     * prior of resampling.
     *
     * Let's take an example:
     * ssSrc = { a, b, c } and ssDst = { a', b', c' } where:
     *              -a / a' are the channel numbers,
     *              -b / b' are the number of bytes used in the audio format.

     * and with (a' > a) and (b' < b)
     * As all sample spec items are different, we need to use 3 converter to reach the destination
     * audio data sample specifications.
     *
     * First take into account a (number of channels):
     *      As a' is higher than a, first performs the remapping:
     *      ssSrc = { a, b, c } dst = { a', b', c' }
     *      The temporary output becomes the new source for next converter
     *      ssSrc = temporary Output = { a', b, c }
     *
     * Then, take into account b (format size).
     *      As b' is lower than b, do not perform the reformating now...
     *
     * Finally, take into account the sample rate:
     *      as they are different, use a resampler:
     *      ssSrc = { a', b, c } dst = { a', b', c' }
     *      The temporary output becomes the new source for next converter
     *      ssSrc = temporary Output = { a', b, c' }
     *
     * No more converter: exit from last recursive call
     * Taking into account b again...(format size)
     *      as b' < b, use a reformatter
     *      ssSrc = { a', b, c' } dst = { a', b', c' }
     *      The temporary output becomes the new source for next converter
     *      ssSrc = temporary Output = { a', b', c' }
     *
     * Exit from recursive call.
